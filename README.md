#Introduction
_pecnv_ is a collection of C++ programs used for the detection of copy-number variation (CNV) by means of paired-end mapping of short reads.  

This software contains the C++ portions of the transposable element (TE) detection pipeline descrbed in:
> Cridland, J.M., S.J. MacDonald, A.D. Long, and K.R Thornton (2013) Abundance and Distribution of Transposable Elements in Two \textit{Drosophila} QTL Mapping Resources  Molecular Biology and Evolution 30: 2311-2327, which is available [here](http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/30/10/2311.full)

The full version of the TE detection pipeline, along with test data, is available from the Thornton lab [website](http://www.molpopgen.org/tepipeline/line99_example.tar.gz).
